// one lung doing the work of two.
// call it as [_patient] call ACME_fnc_ettMainstemTick, from fn_circhandle.
// a tube advanced past the carina goes down the right main bronchus, because that bronchus leaves the trachea at a
// shallower angle than the left. the whole tidal volume then goes into one lung. that lung is over-distended and
// the other is not ventilated at all, so it collapses.
// what this looks like, and why it is a good problem:
// EtCO2 is still fine, because the tube is in the trachea and CO2 is coming back. this is the trap.
// SpO2 drifts down and keeps drifting, because half the lung is doing nothing.
// the pressure climbs, because the same volume is going into half the space.
// the chest moves on only one side, and only one side has breath sounds.
// so the capnograph says everything is fine while the casualty gets worse, and the medic has to notice that the
// numbers disagree with each other. that is the whole lesson.
// the fix is to pull the tube back a frame or two, which is exactly what the airway screen now allows.
