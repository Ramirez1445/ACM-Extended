//
// why this exists.
// a needle decompression is not a procedure with a cost of nothing. every one of them puts a 14 gauge cannula
// through the chest wall into the pleural space, and every one of them leaves a track behind when the cannula
// kinks, clots or falls out. one or two is the price of doing the job. a chest that has been needled four or five
// times has a wall that leaks.
// so needles stay unlimited, because a medic should never be told they may not decompress a chest. what changes
// is that past bilateral the chest starts taking in air on its own, and it keeps doing it.
//
// how it differs from a real pneumothorax, deliberately.
// a traumatic pneumothorax fills fast and it tensions. this does neither. it accumulates at a fraction of the
// rate and it never tensions on its own, so it will not kill anybody on the ground. what it does is make the
// casualty steadily worse over a long time, which is a soft evacuation requirement rather than an emergency: they
// need a chest drain and somebody who can place one, and they are not getting either in the field.
// that is the honest consequence of a needle. it relieves the pressure and it does not close the hole, and the
// only thing that closes the hole is a tube.
//
// the sound is the tell.
// the breath sounds already in the mod, the ones used after ROSC, are played on a steady rhythm rather than the
// random clustering used elsewhere. a regular, quiet, wrong-sounding breath is what a medic notices when nothing
// on the monitor has changed yet.
