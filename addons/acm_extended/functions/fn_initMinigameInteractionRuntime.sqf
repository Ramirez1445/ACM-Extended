// ACE's own self-interaction menu renders over these dialogs and always did. it is the menu you already know.
// ctrl+win opens ACE's real menu in the minigame, exactly as it does everywhere else.

// the filter of the map, reused.
// the goal is ACE's real self-interaction menu, with everything filtered out except the light picker, and with
// no minigame closing. ACE already does all of that on the map, with one line in ace_common:
// ["notOnMap", {!visiblemap}] call ace_common_fnc_addCanInteractWithCondition;
// that is the whole mechanism. every action carries an exceptions[] list, and any condition not in that list is
// evaluated against it. an action that does not except "notOnMap" therefore fails while the map is open and
// vanishes. ACE_MapFlashlight does except it, so it survives. the short menu on the map is not a special map
// menu. it is the ordinary self-interaction menu with everything that fails one condition removed.
// the menu still opens on the map, rather than being blocked outright, because ACE's own keydown passes
// "notOnMap" in its exceptions too. that distinction is the whole trick. an earlier approach registered a new
// condition, which ACE's keydown does not except, so it blocked the menu from opening at all instead of
// filtering what was inside it.
// the condition map is keyed by name, so re-registering "notOnMap" replaces ACE's. we keep its meaning and add
// ours: not on the map, and not in a minigame. with no minigame open it behaves exactly as ACE wrote it.
// the state is derived from the live displays, never from a stored flag. an earlier version read a boolean that
// the minigames set on open and cleared on close. when a close path failed to run, and one did, the flag stayed
// true forever: the base self-interaction menu stayed filtered down to the flashlight entry for the rest of the
// mission, and ACE interaction was broken on every object in the world. that is a bug in the design, not in the
// close path. a condition ACE reads on every interaction must not depend on our code remembering to clean up
// after itself, because the cost of forgetting once is the whole interaction system, permanently, with no way
// for the player to recover. a display handle held in uinamespace becomes displaynull the instant the engine
// destroys the display. no route, not escape, a script error, ACE closing it or a mission event, can leave it
// stuck true. the engine clears it, and it cannot forget.
// we also block ACE from opening its menu over a dialog. ACE's keydown runs while {dialog} do { closedialog 0;
// } before it opens anything. our display KeyDown handler returning true does not stop that, because CBA's
// keybind system fires independently of our handler, so ACE runs anyway and closes the panel out from under us.
// the block is the only thing that prevents it, because ACE's caninteractwith check sits above that closedialog
// loop and a failing condition makes it bail out early. take it away and ctrl+win in a dialog minigame closes
// the minigame and opens the world menu.
// there are three states, and the middle one is why this is not a simple boolean:
// no minigame open, allow.
// minigame open as a dialog, block, because ACE would close it. our in-panel picker handles the key instead.
// minigame open as a display, allow, because a display is not a dialog, so ACE has nothing to close and its
// menu can open over the panel and be filtered down by notOnMap below.
// notOnMap is re-registered after ACE's own postinit, because ace_common_fnc_addCanInteractWithCondition
// overwrites by name. ACE registers ["notOnMap", {!visiblemap}] in its xeh_postinit, and if our extension runs
// first ACE clobbers it and the minigame filter dies silently. that is exactly why ctrl+win kept opening the
// full self-interact instead of our filtered flashlight menu. addon postinit order is not guaranteed, so we
// re-register on a short delay, after every addon's postinit has run, to guarantee ours wins.
// there is deliberately no separate condition that blocks all interaction while a minigame is open. an earlier
// build registered one, acme_minigameblocksinteract, as a global caninteractwith gate. a global gate blocks
// every action that does not list it in exceptions, and our flashlight action cannot except a private condition
// name, so that gate blocked the flashlight too. ctrl+win in a minigame then opened an empty menu with no
// options at all. the minigame is a dialog and already owns the mouse and the focus, so no extra gate is
// needed. notOnMap alone does the filtering.
