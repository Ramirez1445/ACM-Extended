// under hardcore the machine stops covering for you, which is the honest version. a ventilator is one of the few
// pieces of kit that will kill a patient by working exactly as instructed.
// ventilator-induced lung injury: too much volume per breath overdistends alveoli, and the damage is cumulative and
// permanent for the rest of the day of the casualty. lung-protective ventilation is 6 to 8 ml/kg, and the reason
// that number is drilled into everybody is that the machine will happily deliver twelve.
// enough of it and the lung stiffens, which raises the pressure needed, which tempts the operator to turn the
// pressure limit up, which does more damage. that loop is the point.
